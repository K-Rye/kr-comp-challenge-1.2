# kr-comp-challenge-1.2

This was a fun project that really allowed me to dig into exploring "grid" layouts. 
The theme is a little random and in the future I will work on creating something that is a little more cohesive but I am happy 
with the way the color palate and photos compliment each other. I struggled with the sizing the full screen layout despite 
research and pairings. I figured out a way to make it work but I am still on the hunt for a better way. All in all, I enjoyed 
the build out and look forward to future projects where I can continue improve my css skills.
